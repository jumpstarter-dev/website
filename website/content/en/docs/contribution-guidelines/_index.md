If you want to contribute to Jumpstarter you can write a PR to
one of our repositories (small changes and bugfixes), if you plan
on implementing a new feature or a new driver, we recommend you to
contact us first, this project is moving rapidly and we'd love to
make it easier for you to contribute.

Get in touch with us via our [Community](/community/) page, we have a weekly
meeting as well as a matrix channel.

This contribution guideline is still under development and our community is
very new, so we are open to suggestions on how to improve it.
