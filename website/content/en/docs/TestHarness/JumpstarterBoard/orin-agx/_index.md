## Troubleshooting
### My console doesn't show anything
See the [Console access](#console-access) section and associate the TOPO USB console to your board.

### My DUT doesn't power on
* Check that the AUTO-POWER jumper is connected.
* See [Know issues and limitations](/docs/testharness/jumpstarterboard/#known-issues-and-limitations) you may need to flip the USB-C cable going to the AGX board or the power adapter USB-C.

### My console shows garbage during boot
There is a known issue with the TOPO USB console, where it will show garbage after power-on, then it
recovers. We are working on a workaround for the issue.

### The system won't boot from the USB disk
You need to go into the UEFI BIOS and change the boot order to setup "new devices"
as the first boot option. Make sure that the USB devices is found.

Make sure that you are not using a USB3.1 Gen2 device (10Gbps), as this is not supported yet.

## Power sequencing
The Orin AGX Devkit has an automation header that can be used to control the power
and reset of the board. The jumpstarter board can be used to control the power
and reset of the Orin AGX Devkit in addition to the analog power control.

This is useful to workaround the isue described in [My console shows garbage during boot](#my-console-shows-garbage-during-boot), since the NVIDIA TOPO USB controller has a bug
that will corrupt the console during first boot after power-on on some usb hosts. With
this feature we can avoid power cycling the topo chip but still controll power-on/off
of the board.

The recommended setting is:

`jumpstarter set-config device-id power_on p1,bL,w5,bZ`

`jumpstarter set-config device-id power_off p1,bL,w5,bZ,w10,bL,w110,bZ`

`jumpstarter set-config device-id power_rescue p1,bL,w1,bZ,w1,aL,rL,w1,rZ,w1,aZ`

See the [Power sequencing](/docs/reference/command-line/#power_onoffrecue-parameters) configuration
details.

## Console access
The Orin AGX Devkit only exposes the UEFI and kernel serial console via the
micro USB port (also known as the NVIDIA TOPO USB controller).

Please see [The Orin AGX Devkit layout](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-agx-orin-devkit-user-guide/developer_kit_layout.html) for more details.

To let jumpstarter know that it must look up for a specific usb serial port device
when trying to interact with the DUT console you will need to associate the
NVIDIA TOPO USB Console to your jumpstarter board using the
[usb-set-console](/docs/reference/#set-usb-console) command.

i.e. when the Orin AGX TOPO console shows up like this on the host:

{{< highlight "" >}}
[300810.229025] usb 1-1.3.1: new full-speed USB device number 27 using xhci_hcd
[300810.332797] usb 1-1.3.1: New USB device found, idVendor=0955, idProduct=7045, bcdDevice= 0.01
[300810.332799] usb 1-1.3.1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3

[300810.332801] usb 1-1.3.1: SerialNumber: TOPOD83B461B
{{< /highlight >}}

You should associate it to the jumpstarter board using the following command:

{{< highlight "" >}}
$ jumpstarter set-usb-console orin-agx-00 TOPOD83B461B-if01

Ethernet from the Orin AGX Devkit is connected to the a switch
where the host running jumpstarter has connectivity.

One USB is connected to the jumpstarter DUT storage connector (J8)

The Power USB-C connection is connected to J5 on the jumpstarter.
