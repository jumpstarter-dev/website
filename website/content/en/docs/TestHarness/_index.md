Jumpstarter provides a driver architecture to enable the easy contribution of additional test harnesses,
but today only the jumpstarter-board is supported.

We recognize that the jumpstarter-board could help test many general edge devices, but complex
devices may require a custom test harness, and we also understand that customers may have
already their own harnesses in place. **One of our design goals was to make it very easy
to add new test harnes drivers** to Jumpstarter.
