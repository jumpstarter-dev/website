Jumpstarter provides two modes of operation, a distributed mode, and a local-only mode.

The local-only mode is useful for development and testing of Jumpstarter drivers, and
very small labs, while the distributed mode is useful for bigger, more distributed labs
where collaboration across teams, seamless CI integration and device sharing is needed.
